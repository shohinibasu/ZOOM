To be fair, online zoom classes arenâ€™t as lively as the physical in-class setting, but they are also the only source to impart knowledge in this pandemic. 
Zoom classes are a godsend for all who are stuck in the last few months to complete their courses. 
However, like all things virtual, online classes have their share of pros and cons.

To list the pros, one that tops my list of priorities is that I have flexible work hours and I can schedule my classes and let everyone know at once. 
The features of screen sharing or the whiteboard makes the online teaching process very straightforward. 
What adds to the ease of using this app is the control a facilitator has over his class room.
