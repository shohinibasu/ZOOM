# Is Zoom the best video conference platform?

Zoom is one of the most sought after video-conferencing apps whoâ€™s popularity skyrocketed during the last few months. 
What made Zoom so admirable in the market was its ease of use, scalability, and flexibility. 
Zoom boasts unique features like adding a large number of participants scaling up to thousands, breakout rooms in meetings for discussions, screen sharing, recording videos, and the control it gives to the facilitator.

Features like muting participants, raising hands that alert the presenter, choosing to turn off the video, or switch off the mic add to the flexibility of the app. 
The AES encryptions, TLS encryption, SRTP encryptions, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption, and the updated E2EE or end to end encryption scale up the level of security of the app.

What makes Zoom apt for a professional platform is holding instant or scheduled meetings, private and group chats, scheduling options with Google, Outlook, and Yahoo, and telephonic joining. 
The features of whiteboarding, high-quality video and audio, and holding an unlimited number of meetings are some of the many indispensable attributes of the app.

Zoom made its application almost perfect for a professional meetup but not so much for a casual video calling. 
Many users also complain that many of the best features of the app remain hidden and need tech-savvy to discover them. 
However, the acquisitions against security issues made the developers promptly come up with solutions.
